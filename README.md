# Challenge 7 - Daily Planner
A repository for the Module 7 Challenge - making a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This Work Day Scheduler will show you the current date and allow you to add itinerary items by the hour. Red indicates past time, green indicates current time and purple indicates future time. Your itinerary is saved locally and is still displayed on refresh unless calendar is cleared.

# Installation
GitHub Pages: https://dija-64.github.io/Challenge-7-Daily-Planner/ 

# Usage
Input an event into the calendar at a time of your choosing and click save. This is saved locally so it will appear on refresh of the page. To clear your saved events, press the 'Clear Calendar' button
